FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
For small to medium datasets, a flat index (IndexFlatIP or IndexFlatL2) is simple and effective.
For larger datasets, IVF or HNSW indexes can improve recall-latency trade-offs.
In RAG, the retrieval step finds the top-k chunks most similar to the query embedding.
Top-k is a tuning knob: too low misses context; too high can add noise or exceed prompt limits.
Store embeddings alongside metadata so you can display which chunks were used and trace answers to sources.
